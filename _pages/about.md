Hello, My name is Dale Seo from Seoul, Korea.
I'm a software engineer, specifically a back-end developer.
My job requires me to develop server applications but I'm also interested in front-end development.
Actually, I pursue a career as a full-stack developer.
I enjoy learning new skills and share what I've learned.
That's why I started blogging.
I try to translate online tutorials to Korean because I'd like to translate a book someday.
